This project is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application for a simple, interactive Number Guessing Game. The player sets a range of numbers and a limited number of attempts, and then tries to guess a randomly generated number within that range.


How to Play
Set the Range: Enter the minimum and maximum values for the number range.
Set the Chances: Specify how many attempts youâ€™d like.
Start Guessing: Enter a guess within the range.
Feedback: The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, until you either find the correct number or run out of chances.

Technologies Used
